\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this assignment was to evaluate an Image Annotation system created by another pair of students from the Human Computer Interaction course who were chosen at random.  In order to do this, we were instructed to gather feedback from a naive user (a person who was not familiar with the aims of the exercise but of the target audience) with regards to how easy they found the system to use and what they thought could be improved upon.  William Ogilvie's brother was chosen to act the part of the user because he is not university educated, he has no knowledge of Computer Science per se, but is someone who uses a computer frequently and does have a keen interest in photography making him an ideal participant in that he is a potential user of the system under test.
