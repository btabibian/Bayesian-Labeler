\section{Introduction}
The aim of this assignment was to design, build and evaluate an application in which users can identify, mark and label objects within images.  The application is specifically intended to be helpful for developers or researchers in quickly producing datasets of fully annotated images.

The C++ programming language was used, in conjunction with the Qt framework\cite{QtFramework}, to create the application; this was chosen since we were both familiar with it and felt this would aid in a speedy development process.

Due to time constraints, the system had to be designed and implemented virtually simultaneously; however, despite this we feel that we have produced a product that fits the use case for which it is intended.  In this report we will discuss the features of the application, the design decisions that were made with respect to those features, and the pros and cons of those decisions.
