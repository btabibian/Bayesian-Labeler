In conclusion, we have tried to stick to the de facto standards of interface design that have been established over many years whilst constructing this application.  With the limited time available we have endevoured to look at each design decision in turn from the perspective of what a user will expect and find most useful; since in the end, ensuring the package is as natural for a person to use as possible is what lies at the very heart of a succesful human computer interaction.
